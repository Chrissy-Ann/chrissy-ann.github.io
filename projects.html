            <h4><strong>Languages and Frameworks:</strong> PHP, Laravel, Laravel Livewire</h4>
            <p>
                This project involved using PHP, the Laravel framework, and Laravel Livewire. We were tasked with
                creating a web application from the ground up, including both the design and the functionality. The application
                needed to be connected to a database, and be able to perform all CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete.)
                I was part of a group of 3, and this was the first time I was part of a group for a programming project. Though there
                are some drawbacks to working in a group -- making decisions requires a group discussion, taking longer -- it was
                ultimately very beneficial to the project. We each had our own strengths, and we brought different ideas to the table.
                I felt the most comfortabe with design, so I took the lead on that aspect, creating a Figma board with different options
                for components and page layouts, as well as colours and fonts. Laravel Livewire uses Flux components, and I struggled a bit
                with that as we hadn't learned it in class, but one of my team members had no trouble. It was great having teammates whose
                strengths complemented each other. We created an idea forum, much like Reddit, where users could post their ideas, comment on others, and like posts. Our
                application included user authentication, and input validation for posts and comments.
            </p>
            <h3 class="project-subheading">Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                When this project was assigned, we had just started learning about Laravel and Livewire. We were learning as we went for
                this project, which was difficult. I found it challenging to learn Flux components, as well as the aspects of the Livewire
                starter kit. We did not cover these topics in class. We also had to learn how to use GitHub as a team, 
                making pull requests and merging branches, which I had not done before. So, while there was definitely a learning curve
                with this project, I had a really great team to help me, and I think our consistent communication is what made this project
                a success.

            <h4><strong>Languages and Frameworks:</strong> C#, Blazor</h4>
            <p>
                This project used Microsoft's Blazor framework for C# to create an application that could register new students into a database,
                list all students and their data, and register them in courses. This was the final project for a course that split the term
                between learning C#, and learning Blazor.
            </p>
            <h3 class="project-subheading">Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                The main challenge of this project was that there were many business rules about course registration. Students were either full time,
                part time, or part of a co-op program. Full time students could register for a maximum of 16 hours a week in courses, part time
                students could register in up to 3 courses, and co-op students could register in up to 2 courses, and for a maximum of 4 hours a week.
                This made validation for the registration form very difficult. I had to keep track of the number of courses selected, and their total
                hours. I also had to ensure that if a student had already been registered in any courses, those were pre-checked when opening the form.
                I found it challenging to handle all the rules for validation, and make sure I was including all other functionality, but what helped
                me was breaking the project instructions down, and tackling things one at a time.

            <h4><strong>Languages and Frameworks:</strong> ASP.NET, C#</h4>
            <p>
                This project was completed across multiple labs, each adding more functionality. The goal was to create an application
                using ASP.NET and MVC architecture that allowed a user to register new employees into a database, edit existing ones,
                as well as edit grades of students. The first lab involved using Visual Studio to generate code from the database.
                I set up a page to display a record of a student, their course, and an input field for their grade to allow users to edit.
                The second lab focused on view models, a class designed for a specific view with a form that involves multiple entities. 
                In this project, the employee registration form involved both the employee model, which contained employee name, id and password,
                and the role model which contained the different job titles an employee could have. Having a view model for this page
                made validation much easier, because all the rules and the error messages could be implemented in that one file.
                The final lab was about validation, adding validation to all forms using ASP.NET data annotations for model validation,
                as well as changing form lables and table headings to be more descriptive and user-friendly.

            <p>
                It was hard at first to follow the MVC architecture. I had to figure out which file different aspects of the code should be in,
                unlike Razor Pages, which we had been learning previously, that has a file for the presentation layer and one for the code behind.

            <h4><strong>Languages and Frameworks:</strong> PHP</h4>
            <p>
                This was my first project using PHP. Each week, one stage of the project would be due, and the next week, we would
                expand, adding new features or refactoring how the code was set up. The task was to create a table of invoices,
                displaying multiple fields such as client name, amount owed, and whether the invoice was paid, pending or a draft. We started
                out using a hardcoded data array to pull the information from, and different pages for each possible status of an invoice
                that displayed a sorted list. As we progressed through the project, it was cut down to one page and the sorting was controlled by
                the query string, and a database was created to store the data. Multiple aspects of this project utilized major PHP
                superglobal variables, which made me much more comfortable with their function. I also learned about PHP components,
                and how they are very useful for code that is reused, without rewriting it. By the end of the project, a user could
                create a new entry for an invoice, and edit and delete an existing one.

            <p>
                Since this was my first PHP project, there was a bit of a learning curve in the beginning. I had to get used to the syntax,
                specifically for loops and conditional statements. It took me awhile to remember to close each one by adding an endif; or
                endforeach; for example.

            <h4><strong>Languages and Frameworks:</strong> CSS, HTML</h4>
            <p>
                This project used CSS and HTML to create a company landing page. The layout had to match given images for multiple
                screen sizes, computer, tablet and mobile. The project helped me learn different CSS attributes, as well as how to tweak the
                code to better match the image.
            </p>
            <h3 class="project-subheading">Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                I had a bit of trouble with the background image for this site. I had figure out how to position it in a way that would match
                where it should be for each screen size. I solved this by positioning the image inside a div for the smaller screen sizes,
                instead of within the body, like I did for the desktop screen. The tablet and mobile versions had the image in a different spot.

            <h3 class="project-subheading">About the Project</h3>
            <h4><strong>Languages and Frameworks:</strong> Python</h4>
            <p>
                For a Python lab, I was tasked with creating a script that translated user text input to morse code. I created a dictionary
                containing the corresponding dots and dashes for each letter in the alphabet. I created functions to convert the input
                to lower case, then to morse code. Using a connected Circuit Playground circuit board with LEDs, the morse code message would then
                be flashed using the LEDs.
            </p>
            <h3 class="project-subheading">Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                While I ultimately had a lot of fun with this project, there were multiple challenges. Firstly, I had to determine how to use
                the circuit board. I was provided with example functions of how to use the LEDs, as well as the function that dictates the
                amount of time the lights stay on or off. The examples really helped me understand how these functions worked.
                The main difficulty of this project was figuring out how to set up the morse code for the circuit board. There was a different
                set time for between dots and dashes of one letter, between two letters, and between words, 
                so I had to structure it in such a way that I could implement this. I ended up using nested lists, one for each word, and those
                would be contained in a list for the entire sentence.

            <h3 class="project-subheading">About the Project</h3>
            <h4><strong>Languages and Frameworks:</strong> Javascript, HTML</h4>
            <p>
                Mad Libs involved working with forms and event handling. The user selects one of two story options, and then is presented
                with a form to fill in the missing words of the story. Once the form is submitted, a dialog box appears containing
                the completed story. This was done by using string interpolation in the story template with the values submitted by the
                user.
            </p>
            <h3 class="project-subheading">Challenges</h3>
            <p>
                This was my first time using dialog boxes, and handling their events with Javascript. I needed to create multiple event
                listeners, for the story selection, form submission for each story option, and to close the dialog box. I had some
                trouble ensuring only the correct from showed when selected, and neither showing if nothing was selected. I used the 
                bootstrap class "d-none," adding and removing it from the classList of either form, ensuring they were visible when selected
                and hidden when not, and also that they would disappear when closing the dialog box.
